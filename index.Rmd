## Research Question
The aim of the study from which the data was taken (Simmons et al., 2011) was to express that psychology papers contain a lot of false positive results, where analyses are statistically significant but have no real effect. They wanted to prove that by strategically analysing data they could create significance from variables that definitely have no real interaction- that song listened to by participants significantly affected their age, which is obviously impossible. My visualisation aims to address the question of whether choice of covariate in an ancova model has an effect on the significance, by analysing whether song listened to affects participant age or participant’s father’s age.

## Data Origins
The data came from open source repository published by the following study: Simmons, J P, Nelson, L D and Simonsohn, U (2011). False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant. *Psychological Science 22*(11): 1359–1366, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611417632.  
Variable names are responses to nuisance questions, such as ‘what is your favourite football player’, because the original study was just interested in age of participants (‘?’ column) and what song they listened to (‘potato’, when64, or ‘kalimba’). 
The data from the article downloads in .txt form, which I copied and pasted into an Excel spreadsheet as it appeared neater in R. I then uploaded the data in Excel form to GitHub, which is where the data is pulled from by R.
Here are the first few lines of data before processing:

```{r echo=TRUE}
head(s2)
```

## Data wrangling ##

# Remove the columns not used in analysis
# Leaves father and participant age in years, 3 song conditions
st2 <- subset(s2, select=-c(aged, mom, female, root, bird, political, quarterback, olddays, feelold, computer, diner, cond))


# The 3 song conditions (potato, when64, kalimba) are coded '1' if listened to
# and 0 if not listened to
# Replace all '1' values with the participant age value in the same row
# This also retains corresponding father age per song
stu2 <- st2 %>%
  mutate(potato = replace(potato, potato == "1", aged365[potato=="1"])) %>% 
  mutate(when64 = replace(when64, when64 == "1", aged365[when64=="1"])) %>%
  mutate(kalimba = replace(kalimba, kalimba == "1", aged365[kalimba=="1"])) %>% 
  mutate(dad)


#Remove all 0 values from song columns
new1 <- stu2 %>%
  filter(!if_any(starts_with("p"), ~ . == 0))

new2 <- stu2 %>% 
  filter(!if_any(starts_with("w"), ~ . == 0))

new3 <- stu2 %>% 
  filter(!if_any(starts_with("k"), ~ . == 0))


# Index to further remove unwanted columns
new1pot <- new1[,-3:-5]

new2when <- new2[,-2,-4,-5]

new3kal <- new3[,-2,-3,-5]


# Create new column song type with the same number of values
# as are in the existing column, for each song
song1 <- c("Potato", "Potato", "Potato", "Potato", "Potato", 
           "Potato", "Potato", "Potato", "Potato", "Potato", 
           "Potato", "Potato", "Potato", "Potato")

song2 <- c("When", "When", "When", "When", "When", 
           "When", "When", "When", "When", "When", 
           "When")

song3 <- c("Kalimba", "Kalimba", "Kalimba", "Kalimba",
           "Kalimba", "Kalimba", "Kalimba", "Kalimba",
           "Kalimba")

# Add new column to each existing corresponding data frame 
# containing participant age and father age
newpot <- new1pot %>% 
  mutate(song1)

newwhen <- new2when %>% 
  mutate(song2)

newkal <- new3kal %>% 
  mutate(song3)


# Create a data frame containing columns: father age, participant age, song type
datafra <- data.frame(dadage = c(newpot$dad, newwhen$dad, newkal$dad),
                      pptage = c(newpot$potato, newwhen$when64, newkal$kalimba),
                      song = rep(c(newpot$song1, newwhen$song2, newkal$song3)))


# Convert song type column from a character to a factor for statistical analyses
factor_song <- as.factor(datafra$song)
class(factor_song)


# Replace the character column with the new factor column in a data frame
df1 <- datafra
df1$factor_song <- factor_song
df1 <- df1[, -3]

```

## Data Preparation
The first step was to remove all the nuisance variables, leaving only the necessary ones for analysis- participant age, father age, potato, kalimba, when64. The song variables were coded as 1 or 0 depending on if they listened to that song or not. These variables were then recoded to only keep rows which were listened to (1) for each song. Ultimately, this left a dataframe with 3 columns; participant age, father age, and song listened to.

head(df1)
```

# Add the p values to the plot for participant and dad
# Save the plot

                label = c("p = 0.011*", "p = 0.248", "p = 0.317"), color= 'firebrick2')+
      annotate("text", x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(0.9, 1.2, 0.5),

```


## Summary
This vizualisation shows that false significance can be created from nonesense variables through careful manipulation of statistical analyses. With more time, the study could have been stretched to include more data, such as from study 1 dataset of the original paper. It is limited in that it only shows data from 42 participants, with each group having an unequal number of participants, but this information is not displayed on the graph. This kind of data being shown would have enriched the vizualisation by further expressing how statistical analyses can hide the meaningful origins of the data. Future research could investigate the effect of unequal group size on post hoc comparisons in ANCOVAs.
